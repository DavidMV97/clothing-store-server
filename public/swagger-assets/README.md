Place your custom Swagger UI assets here:

- favicon.ico  -> served at /swagger-assets/favicon.ico
- logo.png     -> used in the topbar background via customCss

Notes:
- The server already serves this folder statically at /swagger-assets.
- You can change the CSS in `index.js` (customCss option) to adjust placement, size or remove the default text.
- If you don't provide assets, Swagger UI will fall back to its default icon and logo.
